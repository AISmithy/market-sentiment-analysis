# Market Sentiment Analysis

This project is a Python-based application that analyzes the sentiment of financial market news for a given stock ticker. It fetches the latest news from Yahoo Finance and uses a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) from Hugging Face to determine if the sentiment of the news is positive, negative, or neutral.
